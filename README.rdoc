*NOTE*:: Heroku has ceased to support the bundles functionality that powered this plugin. Any apps created after 11/30/10 will not have access to the Bundles add-on, and it will cease to function completely by 2/1/11. See http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2010/12/1/bundles-deprecation/ for more details.

= Heroku Backup Command

Plugin that provides the backup command for the heroku gem. This allows you
to automate the process of backing up bundles to S3.

== Installation

If you haven't already, install hone's fabulous herocutter plugin:

    $ heroku plugins:install git://github.com/hone/heroku_herocutter.git

After that, a simple

    $ heroku plugins:install backup

will get you up and running.

== Setup

This plugin requires two environment variables:

    AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID

    AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

You can also still use the old style - namely, using +config/amazon_s3.yml+
(the S3 config file used with the paperclip gem).  Another option would be
to store these keys on Heroku and retrieve them from there, allowing this
plugin to work from any collaborator's machine.  If you want to implement
this, then fork fork fork it!

You'll also need to make sure that you've enabled the Single Bundle addon
for your app:

    $ heroku addons:add bundles:single

== Usage

From your project's root directory:

    $ heroku backup

That'll make the magic happen.
